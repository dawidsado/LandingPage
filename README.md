# LandingPage 🌐


## •	ABOUT

I use my knowledge acquired during the course about fundamental web development technologies (CSS and HTML) to create simple, responsive landing page.

There is an option to send a form (with the use of the Formsubmit.io platform) to contact me.

I also created anchors, to other locations within the same page (to the projects section) and to locations outside the page (to GitHub).
